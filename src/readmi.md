"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising hj was 
born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of dislikes
avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
 pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor aga is 
there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain hj of itself, because it is hj,
 but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and hj can procure him some
   great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
      exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault
       with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
        avoids a hj that produces no resultant pleasure?"
